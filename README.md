# About
ParkBliss a parking spot recording application utilizing the NFC technology. 

# Motivation
The mental and physical effort taken to remember a parked car’s location can be cumbersome. For example:  taking a picture of the parking spot, remembering the spot in one’s head, writing down the spot, or saving the spot on a mobile device. These actions all require the user to allocate time and energy to achieve. 
Therefore, we want to identify a way to streamline the experience and come to our solution — Park Bliss.

# Development 
Park Bliss is a user-centered app. From identifying problems, researching literature, to gathering requirements through interviews, we incorporated a number of user tests into the development process. In the end, we came up with three core functions - record, retrieve, share, and decided on iOS as the platform for our first practice.
